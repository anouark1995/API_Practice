"""
Application entry point.

This is where all the pieces come together:
- create the FastAPI app
- create the DB tables on startup (for a teaching app; in production you'd
  use a migration tool like Alembic instead)
- include the routers from routes/ so their endpoints are live

Run locally with:
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 1234
Then open http://127.0.0.1:1234/docs for the auto-generated API UI.
